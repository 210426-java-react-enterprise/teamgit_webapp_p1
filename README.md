Once you've installed the API, make sure to run a maven install to add the dependency to your local repository:

mvn install
```
Once the dependency is setup, and you want to try out the webapp, you can then import the dependency as a maven dependency in the webapp:
```
       <dependency>
            <groupId>teamgit.orm</groupId>
            <artifactId>teamgit_orm_p1</artifactId>
